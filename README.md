<h3 align="center">Text</h3>
<b>Text</b> is any types of content in the program. it will be letters,numbers and other characters. for example some html tags like (html,head,body etc...) and other form of all programming languages are the best examples of text. 
<h3 align="center">Calculator</h3>
<b>Calculators</b> are compilers and interpreters that change code texts into functional usage. Both compilers and interpreters are used to convert a program written in a high-level language into machine code understood by computers. However, there are differences between how an interpreter and a compiler works. a computer does not understand high-level language. It only understands the program written in 0's and 1's in binary, called the machine code
<h3 align="center">Storage</h3>
<b>storage</b> is a place that store codes that we made in the calculators. It uses as a server and database for codes. It is a memory place.
